# About Project:
The Simon Game project is a modern take on the classic electronic memory game "Simon." This interactive game challenges players to remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. The primary objective of this project is to create an engaging and visually appealing game that tests and enhances players' memory and concentration skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
